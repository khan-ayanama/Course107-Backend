# Normalization

Normalization is a process used to organize data efficiently and reduce data redundancy. It involves breaking down a database into smaller, related tables while ensuring that each table has a clear and specific purpose. The primary goals of normalization are to eliminate data anomalies and improve data integrity. There are several normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF, etc.), each with its own set of rules. Here, I'll explain the first three normal forms, which are the most commonly used:

## First Normal Form (1NF)

* Each table should have a primary key, which uniquely identifies each row.
* Each column in a table must have atomic (indivisible) values. There should be no repeating groups or arrays in a column.
* Data in each column must be of the same data type.

## Second Normal Form (2NF)

* The table must be in 1NF.
* There should be no partial dependencies. In other words, non-key attributes should be fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.
* If the primary key consists of multiple columns, each non-key column should depend on the entire composite primary key, not just a part of it.

## Third Normal Form (3NF)

* The table must be in 2NF.
* There should be no transitive dependencies. In other words, non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes.
* Any column that is not part of the primary key should only depend on the primary key.

Normalization helps improve data integrity, reduce data redundancy, and simplify data maintenance. However, it's essential to strike a balance between normalization and performance. Over-normalization can lead to complex queries and slower performance, so it's important to consider the specific requirements of your application when designing the database schema.
